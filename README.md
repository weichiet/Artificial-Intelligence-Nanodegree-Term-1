# Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree - Term 1

## Program Description

Global innovations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) are going to redefine virtually every aspect of our lives. Students who master AI skills today will play a critical role in helping determine how this incredible technology impacts our future. This [program](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889) will introduce you to the broad field of artificial intelligence, and prepare you for a wide variety of opportunities in the AI field.

## Projects: Term 1  

1. Solve a Sudoku with AI   
Design and implement two extensions of our sudoku solver. The first one will be to implement the technique called "naked twins". The second one will be to modify existing code to solve a diagonal sudoku. The goals are to implement the naked twins function, and write an AI agent that will solve the Diagonal Sudoku game.  

2. Build a Game-Playing Agent  
Design and implement an agent to play the game of Isolation, a deterministic, two-player game in which the players alternate turns moving between cells on a regular grid till one of them has no more moves left. Use adversarial search with heuristic evaluation functions to overcome computational challenges and make your agent a smarter player.    

3. Implement Simulated Annealing Algorithm  
Implement the simulated annealing algorithm in a Jupyter notebook and use it to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) between U.S. state capitals.

4. Explore Constraint Satisfaction Problems  
Explore Constraint Satisfaction problems by implementing the N-Queens problem using symbolic constraints in a Jupyter notebook, and solving it using the Backtracking Search algorithm.

5. Implement a Planning Search  
Solve air cargo logistics problems by decomposing them into individual actions using a formal planning framework, identifying dependencies and effects of each action, and generating valid plans using search techniques. Experiment with various automatically generated heuristics, including planning graph heuristics, and provide an analysis of your results.

6. Design a Sign Language Recognition System  
Use Hidden Markov Models to recognize gestures in American Sign Language, from individual words to complete sentences. Train it on a dataset of videos that have been pre-processed and annotated, and test on novel sequences. Improve your recognizer by finding the best English translation of each sentence.
