## Projects: Term 1  

1. [Solve a Sudoku with AI](./sudoku)   
Created an AI to solve Diagonal Sudokus using constraint propagation and search techniques. Additionally, taught the agent to use the Naked Twins advanced Sudoku strategy.  

2. [Build a Game-Playing Agent](./isolation)  
Created an AI that beats human opponents in the game of Isolation using Minimax, Alpha-Beta Search, and Iterative Deepening.

3. [Implement Simulated Annealing Algorithm](./simulated_annealing)  
Implemented the simulated annealing algorithm in a Jupyter notebook and used it to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) between U.S. state capitals.

4. [Implement a Planning Search](./planning)  
Used logic and planning techniques to create an AI that finds the most efficient route to route cargo around the world to their respective destinations. This project used a combination of propositional logic and search along with A* heuristics to find optimal planning solutions.

5. [Design a Sign Language Recognition System](./recognizer)  
Built a system to recognize gestures in American Sign Language, from individual words to complete sentences. This project trained a set of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) on a dataset of videos that have been pre-processed and annotated, and test on novel sequences.
