# Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree
## Introductory Project: Diagonal Sudoku Solver

In this project, you will be writing code to implement two extensions of our sudoku solver. The first one will be to implement the technique called "naked twins". The second one will be to modify our existing code to solve a diagonal sudoku. The goals are to implement the naked twins function, and write an AI agent that will solve the Diagonal Sudoku game.

## Naked Twins
The naked twins technique is the following. Consider the following puzzle, and look at the two highlighted boxes, ``'F3'`` and ``'I3'``.

As you can see, we've removed the values 2 and 3 from the boxes ``'D3'`` and ``'E3'``. This is the naked twins technique. In this project, you'll write a function that implements this technique.

### Question 1 (Naked Twins)
Q: How do we use constraint propagation to solve the naked twins problem?  
A: If 2 boxes within the same unit have identical 2 possible values, it implies:  

* The 2 boxes can contain one of the possible value and therefore,   
* No other boxes in their same unit can contain these 2 values.

Based on this constraint, we can remove these 2 values from the peers of these 2 boxes in the same unit. This further reduce the number of possibilities of each square and the size of the search space.

## Diagonal Sudoku
A diagonal sudoku is like a regular sudoku, except that among the two main diagonals, the numbers 1 to 9 should all appear exactly once. In this project, you'll modify the functions we've written in the lecture (or you can write your own!) in order to solve every diagonal sudoku.

### Question 2 (Diagonal Sudoku)
Q: How do we use constraint propagation to solve the diagonal sudoku problem?  
A: To solve the diagonal Sudoku problem, we can add the addition diagonal units in additional to row units, column units and square units that defined previously. Adding the diagonal units impose additional constraint because the numbers 1 to 9 can all appear exactly once in the two main diagonals. This constraint further reduces the search space of the solution.

## Instructions
### Install

This project requires **Python 3**.

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.
Please try using the environment we provided in the Anaconda lesson of the Nanodegree.

##### Optional: Pygame

Optionally, you can also install pygame if you want to see your visualization. If you've followed our instructions for setting up our conda environment, you should be all set.

If not, please see how to download pygame [here](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml).

### Code

* `solution.py` - You'll fill this in as part of your solution.
* `solution_test.py` - Do not modify this. You can test your solution by running `python solution_test.py`.
* `PySudoku.py` - Do not modify this. This is code for visualizing your solution.
* `visualize.py` - Do not modify this. This is code for visualizing your solution.

### Visualizing

To visualize your solution, please only assign values to the values_dict using the `assign_value` function provided in solution.py

### Submission
Before submitting your solution to a reviewer, you are required to submit your project to Udacity's Project Assistant, which will provide some initial feedback.  

The setup is simple.  If you have not installed the client tool already, then you may do so with the command `pip install udacity-pa`.  

To submit your code to the project assistant, run `udacity submit` from within the top-level directory of this project.  You will be prompted for a username and password.  If you login using google or facebook, visit [this link](https://project-assistant.udacity.com/auth_tokens/jwt_login) for alternate login instructions.

This process will create a zipfile in your top-level directory named sudoku-<id>.zip.  This is the file that you should submit to the Udacity reviews system.
